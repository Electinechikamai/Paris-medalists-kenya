    <h1>OLYMPICS KENYA MEDALISTS</h1>

    <p>
      Kenya has once again demonstrated its athletic prowess on the world stage,
      emerging as Africa's top-performing nation at the Paris 2024 Olympics.
      With a total of 11 medals, including 4 golds, Kenya has not only led the
      continent in the medal tally but also reinforced its reputation as a
      global powerhouse in athletics. This year, the African continent as a
      whole achieved remarkable success, with 12 countries contributing to a
      combined total of 38 medals, a testament to the growing competitiveness of
      African athletes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kenya's dominance at the Paris Olympics was driven by its long-standing
      strength in athletics, particularly in middle and long-distance events.
      The nation’s athletes once again proved their mettle, with standout
      performances across multiple disciplines.
